## ExcelBuilder - A Groovy Builder for Excel Spreadsheets

This provides a builder-style interface for creating Excel (2007+ format) spreadsheets using the Apache POI library. It is still a work-in-progress, but will be completed by the end of January 2014.

The documentation is currently ... sparse. But the unit tests provide many examples of how to use it.
